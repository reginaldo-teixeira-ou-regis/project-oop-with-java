## Project: Learn in Practice Object Oriented Programming

This project is a user interaction application with a study platform, developed in Java using the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) IDE. During development, we applied the main Object-Oriented Programming tools, such as:

 * **Abstraction:** We used abstraction to model and represent the domain concepts of the study platform in a simplified manner, focusing on the relevant aspects for the system;

 * **Encapsulation:** We applied encapsulation to protect the data and behaviors of the classes, defining the appropriate visibility of attributes and methods, and using getters and setters when necessary.

 * **Inheritance:** We used inheritance to establish a specialization relationship between classes, allowing the creation of subclasses that inherit characteristics and behaviors from a base class.

 * **Polymorphism:** We leveraged polymorphism to enable objects of different classes to be treated polymorphically, meaning they can be treated using a common interface, facilitating code reuse and system flexibility.

By combining these tools, we were able to develop a Java study application that promotes code modularity, maintainability, and extensibility.
